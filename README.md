# 🛳️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) using Python.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore the Titanic dataset using Python and Pandas  
- Perform data cleaning:
  - Handle missing values
  - Convert data types (where appropriate)
- Generate summary statistics and group-based insights  
  (e.g., survival by gender and passenger class)  
- Visualize key patterns and correlations  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn / Matplotlib  

## 📚 Covered Topics
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data types & handling missing data  
- Data visualization  

## ✨ Bonus
- Visualized survival rates using bar plots and heatmaps

## 📊 Example Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males  
- Passengers in higher classes had better chances of survival  
- Correlation heatmaps revealed relationships between fare, class, and survival
